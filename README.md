# CLI utilities in Python
This is a repository containing useful Python scripts made as I have some need of such a utility.

As of editing this README, I am running these with Python 3.6.9 (the version which is standard on Ubuntu LTS 18.04). It should work on any newer version of Python 3.

You can check your version of Python with `python --version` or `python3 --version`. On most systems, you'll end up needing to use `python3`.
