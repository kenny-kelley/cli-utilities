# Command-line interface utilities in Python
This is a repository containing Python scripts for random things I feel like doing.

As of editing this README, I'm running them with Python 3.11.1. Any recent-ish version of Python 3 should do fine.

You can check your version of Python with `python --version` or `python3 --version`. On most systems, you'll end up needing to use `python3`.
